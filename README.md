# PHP Sample Server

This is a model repository for future PHP projects, and also to for practice.

The repository was made to work on Github codespaces so Apache was not configured
and PHP was already pre-installed.

## Running
Open the terminal and run the shell script located at the root directory.

```bash
./start_php.sh
```

The `docker` build and run will take care of everything basically.
Then open your your browser and access localhost on port 8080.
